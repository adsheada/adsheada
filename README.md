### 🚀 About Me

With 15+ years of experience, I engineer scalable, robust data systems that empower teams and drive business strategy. My expertise lies in building cloud-native architectures (GCP & Azure), automating deployments, and orchestrating complex data workflows for terabyte-scale processing.

- **Cloud platforms:** Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub), Azure  
- **Data Engineering:** Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Data Warehousing, ETL  
- **DevOps:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Programming:** Python, Scala, Java, Go, SQL, Bash  
- **Monitoring & AI:** Prometheus, Grafana, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer

I thrive on mentoring teams, leading incident response, and championing clean, modular code and resilient infrastructure. I’m passionate about designing data systems that not only scale, but also empower teams to solve real-world problems.
